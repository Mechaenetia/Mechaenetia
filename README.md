# Mechaenetia
Repository for the Game Mechaenetia

This is my first real public Project, so I need to learn quite a lot about managing things.
Other than that, just having fun learning and creating things, and hope everyone else will too. ^^

TODO:

Stop getting distracted by Factorio and GT6.

Setup Rust Dev Environment for IDEA.

Setup a Localization Library, because I don't want to accidentially miss any localizable Text when designing the UI.

Setup Amethyst and make a Basic Launcher UI.

Setup a Default Workspace of sorts.

Make a proper ReadMe once more stuff such as Libraries has been set up.
