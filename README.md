# Mechaenetia
Repository for the Game Mechaenetia

This is my first real public Project, so I need to learn quite a lot about managing things.
Other than that, just having fun learning and creating things, and hope everyone else will too. ^^

I should mention that there is a few significant Delay Factors on this Project, so I'm trying to do other personal Projects until that is resolved, such as experimenting with Operating Systems and Hardware. Progress will be made one way or another!



TODO:

Learn about a bunch of Operating System things and different Hardware.

Have OvermindDL1 actually available for real help (That will take quite a while)

Stop getting distracted and start learning more Rust and Amethyst Stuff.

Setup proper Rust Dev Environment for IDEA.

Setup a Localization Library, because I don't want to accidentially miss any localizable Text when designing the UI.

Setup Amethyst and make a Basic Launcher UI.

Setup a Default Workspace of sorts.

Make a proper ReadMe once more stuff such as Libraries has been set up.
